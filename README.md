# Grippy-Bot-ArduinoUNO

##About
Grippy, stands for Grip and Copy, is a 3 DOF robotic arm which can record a set of actions and repeat it. The robotic arm's end effector is a mechanical gripper which can be used for pick and place actions. Grippy bot can be easily reprogrammed to carry out a different set of actions by clicking on a button and using the potentiometers to perform the new task. This task will be repeated until reprogrammed. The action's information required to repeat it is stored in the EEPROM of the Arduino Uno board.

##Working:

##Future Scope:
Grippy bot can be used both as a simple robotic arm or as a repetitive task performing arm. It can be controlled remotely by including a Bluetooth module or by using an app and WiFi module.
